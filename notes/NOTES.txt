1 - replace main class with tag
2 - replace variants/modifiers with HTML attributes

BADGES
problems:
- "type"? is used in form controls
- "color"? not very semantic

BREADCRUMBS
how to replace the nav? the structure is simple before, more complex/convoluted later
<nav class="breadcrumb">
    <a class="breadcrumb-item" href="#">Home</a>
    <a class="breadcrumb-item" href="#">Library</a>
    <a class="breadcrumb-item" href="#">Data</a>
    <span class="breadcrumb-item" status="active">Bootstrap</span>
</nav>

3) don't like and hard to read tags like <breadcrumb-item> (+ no highlighting in IDE/text-editor) so decided to move to CamelCase tags

PROGRESS
problems
- <progress> is a reserved word (real tag) so we had to find a different tag name - looked at how Foundation.css does: ProgressBar > ProgressBarMeter
- how do you replace the [hover] here?
    @mixin bg-variant($parent, $color) {
      #{$parent} {
        background-color: $color !important;
      }
      a#{$parent} {
        @include hover-focus {
          background-color: darken($color, 10%) !important;
        }
      }
    }
- continuously seeing visual regression but no idea why
also
- <div class="progress-bar w-75" doesn't makes sense, is a dynamic component! using a workaround to replace it, but should not be a real case to consider
